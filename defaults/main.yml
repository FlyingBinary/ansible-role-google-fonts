# Specify global fonts in a global profile within Superlumic; group and
# personal fonts in the appropriate profiles
#
# Fonts must be correctly capitalised. Fonts with spaces in the name
# must be quoted. Font names are *not* validated, and will fail silently.
# Examples:
#   - "Indie Flower"
#   - "Libre Barcode 128"
#   - "Open Sans"
#   - Raleway
#   - Ubuntu
#
# See the Google Fonts site (https://fonts.google.com) for details of
# the available fonts, and more information on font usage.
#
# The role does nothing unless at least one of these contains at least
# one font name at run time.
